### Objective
A project created to imitate the https://www.monkeytype.com UI.

### Features
- Multiplayer Mode
- Viewing of typing history performance

### Credits
This project copied the quotes and the random words from [Monkey Repository](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype) repository. By slightly tweaking this [Github Repository](https://github.com/lonekorean/highlight-within-textarea/tree/master) I am also able to achieve the text highlight in the textarea of my website. And by utilizing [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) I was able to render the charts easily.
