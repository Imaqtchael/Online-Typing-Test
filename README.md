# Online Typing Test

This is a project that I made because I want to practice my typing speed. 
This project, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows me to keep track of the progress I've made in terms of words per minute and accuracy.

This (Random sentence generator)[http://metaphorpsum.com] and (Random word generator)[https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com] provided an API for my website and 
without them this project will be a lot harder. By slightly tweaking this (Github Repository)[https://github.com/lonekorean/highlight-within-textarea/tree/master]
I am also able to achieve the text highlight in the textarea of my website.
